# Regression Test Reports

This folder contains regression test reports generated by the `/regression-test` command.

## Report Naming Convention
- Single task: `regression-[task-id]-[timestamp].md`
- All tasks: `regression-all-[timestamp].md`

## Report Structure
Each report includes:
- Summary (pass/fail counts, regressions detected)
- Task-by-task results (8 test types)
- Quality scores and coverage metrics
- Suggested fixes for failures
- Action items

## Usage
```bash
# Generate regression report
/regression-test task-011-update-tracking
/regression-test all
```

Reports are automatically saved here after test execution.
